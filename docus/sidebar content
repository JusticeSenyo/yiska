When designing a sidebar, especially for an e-commerce site like yours, the content should be relevant, accessible, and helpful for users to navigate easily. Here are some useful elements you could include in your sidebar:
1. Product Categories

    A list of clickable categories that users can select to filter products. This helps them quickly find what they’re looking for.
        Example: Foods & Beverages, Kitchen Items, Sanitary Products, Beverages, etc.

2. Filters

    Price Range Filter: Allow users to filter products based on price ranges (e.g., GH₵0 - GH₵50, GH₵50 - GH₵100).
    Brand Filter: Show a list of brands that users can select.
    Ratings Filter: Filter by customer ratings (e.g., 4 stars and up).

3. Search Bar

    If you haven't added it elsewhere, having a search bar in the sidebar makes it easier for users to find products quickly.

4. Shopping Cart Preview

    A mini-cart preview showing the number of items and the total price with a link to view or checkout. This gives users constant awareness of what’s in their cart.

5. Featured Products

    Highlight a few key or popular products to capture attention (e.g., Best Sellers, New Arrivals, or Discounted Items).

6. Special Deals/Promotions

    If you have any ongoing promotions, discounts, or special deals, promote them in the sidebar.
        Example: “Buy 1 Get 1 Free,” or “20% off Kitchen Items”.

7. Customer Support Contact Info

    Include contact information like a phone number, email, or a live chat link for users who may need assistance.

8. Wishlist

    A link to the user’s wishlist where they can view products they’ve saved for later.

9. User Account Information (if logged in)

    Show the user’s account details, order history link, or even a login button if they’re not signed in.

10. Newsletter Signup

    Encourage users to sign up for newsletters to receive updates on new products, promotions, and exclusive deals.

11. Social Media Links

    Links to your social media pages (Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, etc.), allowing users to follow your shop for updates.

12. Location & Store Information

    If you have a physical store, include your store location, working hours, or even a map to help users locate you easily.
